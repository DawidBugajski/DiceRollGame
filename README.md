# Dice Roll Game

Game created while watching a course on udemy The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

# How it works?

The game involves two players, each player draws the dice in turn, if there is a 2 - 6 on the dice, the current score will be updated. The player can continue to draw or press the "hold" button which will save his score and pass the move to the other person. If a player keeps rolling the dice, collects, for example, 36 points because he rolled 6 times, but the next roll will be 1, his current score will be reset to zero and the move will be given to the other player. The key here is to act prudently, whether to risk further or save the current score. The player who scores 100 points first wins.

# What have I learned in this project?

First of all, I learned how to use dynamic variables, practiced refactoring my code to make it "dry," worked with DOM elements and understood the basics of scope in functions

# What made me most of the problems?

The biggest problem was not so much understanding technically how to generate active elements, using the cube photo as an example, but coming up with such an idea logically. In addition, a few times I realized that I had problems with the understanding of the "scope" of the function, but I am in the process of learning and will understand it in days :)

# A few words from me

The idea was taken from the course, while I focused on performing it myself. I enjoyed watching and learning what the presenter had to share. In addition, the project was not done under RWD, the main goal here was to practice logic in javascript, so styling was not so important for this project
